                <h2>Soccer Injuries</h2>
                <p>
                  Injuries in soccer are relatively common because of how
                  intense and physical games can get. They range anywhere from
                  minor bruises to major career-changing experiences that could
                  potentially leave a player medically unclear to never step on
                  the pitch again. Injuries are caused by tackles, collisions,
                  fouls, but also happen due to sudden movements, poor playing
                  conditions, and fatigue.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With proper training, quality equipment and fields to play on,
                  a lot of injuries can be prevented. Diet, decision making, and
                  proper warm-ups/stretches before a game also contribute to how
                  severe an injury can be.
