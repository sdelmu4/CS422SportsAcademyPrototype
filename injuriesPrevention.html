                <p class="infoParagraph" style="line-height: 1.5;">
                    Preventing sprains is as simple as getting a good warmup in and properly stretching. The same goes for preventing muscles strains. A good warmup and stretch of 
                    each muscle group before and after practice can improve flexibility.

                <p class="infoParagraph" style="line-height: 1.5;">
                    Professional players are not afraid of crashing into another player or heading the ball. However, as a new player you shouldn't have to worry about this too much.
                    You don't have to force yourself to collide with another player or to hit the ball with your head. You would gradually ease yourself into those conditions.
                </p>
                <p class="infoParagraph" style="line-height: 1.5;">
                    Due to the nature of the sport, sometimes head on collisions are unavoidable and can result in injury of fractured bones or trauma to the head. If anything, as a new player,
                    you don't need to play aggressively.
