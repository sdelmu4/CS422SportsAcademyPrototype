                        <p style="margin-right: 20em;line-height: 1.5;">
                            Cone dribbling is a type of dribbling technique used in practice that you would make you use a cone in the middle
                            of their area and have players be able to have the ball be dribbled towards the cone and come back.
                            Other times the player would dribble past the cone and swap places with another player while dribbling
                            the ball.
                        </p>

                        <p style="margin-right: 20em;line-height: 1.5;">
                            This type of dribbling would be used to trick the opponent with where the ball is going to go using a circular
                            motion on the ball while facing off the opponent. You kick the ball with your opposite foot pushing the ball in
                            another direction and accelerating. 
                        </p>

                        <p style="margin-right: 20em;line-height: 1.5;">
                            This type of technique is used when you are close to the goal and make it seem like you are going to
                            hit a shot. You pretend to shoot the ball but you either pull the ball away or side step to have the defender
                            fooled.

                            make a quick decision and exchanges to other players in your team in tight spaces.

                            Using a long pass would be used when trying to get the ball as far away from your goalie to prevent
                            a goal. Normally with this you would need to do kick the ball high in the air to prevent the enemy team
                            from getting the ball.
