                <h2>About Soccer</h2>
                <p>
                  Soccer, also known as football in other parts of the world, is
                  a sport where two teams of 11 players each compete against one
                  another to end the game with the most goals. Among the 11
                  players on a team, there is a goalkeeper who's the primary
                  defender for your team. Each match at a professional level
                  lasts 90 minutes. This is divided with two 45-minute halves
                  and after the first half, a 10-15 minute break is given.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Games are played on a pitch that typically measure 120 by 75
                  meters. The ball that is used is created from synthetic
                  materials to make sure that it can withstand all environment
                  and weather conditions. Lastly, there is a team uniform that
                  is followed for each team. This usually consists of jerseys
                  (goalie having a seperate uniform than the rest), shorts,
                  socks, shin guards for protection, and cleats!

                    around injuring or endangering your opponent

                  <li>
                    As a goalkeeper, you're allowed to use your hands to pick up
                    the ball and handle it only within your penalty area.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Playing the game tactically is allowed and encouraged. This
                    means you're not punished for passing the ball back towards
                    your own half, shielding the ball so that the opponent
                    doesn't get to it, or even committing tactical fouls that
                    are within reason.

                    your head, body, or feet are nearer to the opponents goal

                    inappropriate behavior is not allowed and can even lead to

                <h2>Yellow Cards And Red Cards</h2>
                <p>
                  Based on how severe a foul is committed, a player may receieve
                  a yellow or red card. These cards represent the "status" of a
                  player and whether they're in good standing if they have no
                  cards, are given warnings if given a yellow card, or if
                  ejected from the game if given a red card. Note that, if given
                  two yellow cards in the same game, it'll convert your cards
                  into a red, ejecting you from the game as well. This leaves
                  your team down one player that cannot be brought back, meaning
                  your total number of players goes from 11 to 10.
