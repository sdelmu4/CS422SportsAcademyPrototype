                    When playing soccer, we want to have fun, and getting injured is the last thing we want.
                    Here, we will discuss the common injuries that occur most in a game of Soccer.

                        <div class="subSectionTitle">Sprains</div>
                        <p style="margin-right: 20em;line-height: 1.5;">Sprains and strains are most like what comes to mind first when thinking about soccer injuries. A lot of movement is focused on the lower half of the body,
                            and you'd most likely expect ankle sprains. However, ankles aren't the only thing that can get sprained when well playing soccer. You can also sprain your knees,
                            specifically the knee ligaments. Sprains occur when a ligament is stretched too far or torn.
                        </p>
                        <div class="subSectionTitle">Strains</div>
                        <p style="margin-right: 20em;line-height: 1.5;"> In addition, you can also strain your muscles. Muscle strains can occur when you pull a muscle too far in a direction, 
                            contracting a muscle hard against resistance, or contracting a muscle hard when it is not ready.
                        </p>
                        <div class="subSectionTitle">Common Strained Muscles:</div>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Groin</li>
                            <li>Quadriceps</li>
                            <li>Hamstrings</li>
                            <li>Calf</li>
                        </ul>

                        <div class="subSectionTitle">Leg Fractures</div>
                        <p style="margin-right: 20em;line-height: 1.5;"> As mentioned before, a lot of movement is done by the lower half of the body. A such, bone fractures in the legs
                            are very common. The most common fractures generally involve lower leg, ankle, and foot bones.
                        </p>

                        <p style="margin-right: 20em;line-height: 1.5;">Other fractures that occur, but less common:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Wrist fractures from falls</li>
                            <li>Rib fractures from direct contact with other players</li>
                            <li>Rarely jaw fractures</li>
                        </ul>

                        <div class="subSectionTitle">Concussions and Facial Injuries</div>
                        <p style="margin-right: 20em;line-height: 1.5;"> Even in soccer, where every thing is focused at your feet, head injuries can still happen. Players may be jumping
                            to hit the ball with their head, or maybe jumping over another fallen player. Nonetheless, head injuries are still possible, and also quite common in Soccer.
                            Most head injuries occur during contact with another player, or the goal post.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-right: 20em;line-height: 1.5;"> Concussions are a rather complex topic as there many levels to them. One thing to know is that properly heading a ball
                            does not result in concussion.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-right: 20em;line-height: 1.5;"> Other Head injuries also include dental and eye injuries, which are less common.
                        </p>

                        <div class="subSectionTitle">Skin Abrasions and Cuts</div>
                        <p style="margin-right: 20em;line-height: 1.5;"> In soccer, abrasions and cuts can occur in soccer matches and practice generally from contact with other players. 
                            Injuries range from the minor scrapes to possibly worse conditions.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-right: 20em;line-height: 1.5;"> In other words, you can expect scrape knees and the like.
