                  class="bulletedList"
                  style="
                    height: 80%;

                  <li>
                    Practicing drills are a great way to train your mind and
                    body into being able to perform these skills. Using cones to

                    want to adapt to, can also be beneficial. Sometimes it can
                    take watching someone else play to be able to take in and
                    learn how and why they're performing a skill.

                    improve how you react in certain situations and help you
                    develop your decision making. Because of the tighter space
                    available, you'll be forced to learn and adapt to quick time
                    actions.
                  </li>
