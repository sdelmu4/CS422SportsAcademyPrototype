                    The sport consists of two end goals, typically with 11 players on the field for each team.
                    10 players are active on the field with 1 goalie. This is the setup both teams have. The game is 
                    primarily played using your lower half of your body, however you're allowed to use any part of your 
                    body besides your arms and hands to control the ball. Most games, at a professional level, are played 
                    with two halves of 45 minutes, plus injury time. Injury time is just extra added time because of any injuries or 
                    occurrences that may have taken time from the game.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-right: 20em;line-height: 1.5;"> 
                    The main goal of the sport is to score as many goals against the opposition team as possible. 
                    As mentioned previously, you must score goals without using your hands or arms, and without 
                    committing any illegal moves in the build up of the goal or else it can get ruled as a no-goal.
                    Once the 2nd half of the game is over, the team with the most goals is declared the winner.

                <p style="margin-right: 20em;line-height: 1.5;">
                    Fouls are calls made by the referee where unfair behavior or actions are committed to try and get 
                    an advantage in the game. This includes things such as aggresive actions towards players like 
                    kicking, pushing, or even hitting them. Referees can also call a foul on a player based on their behavior. An 
                    example of this would be for a player being unsportsmanlike. This includes but is not limited to 
                    arguing with players or wasting time on purpose. Depending on the severity of the foul, referees may
                    give a player a yellow or red card depedning on their actions.
                </p>
                <div class="subSectionTitle">Yellow/Red Cards</div>
                <p style="margin-right: 20em;line-height: 1.5;"> 
                    Based on how severe a foul is committed, a player may receieve a yellow or red card. These cards 
                    represent the "status" of a player and whether they're in good standing if they have no cards, are 
                    given warnings if given a yellow card, or if ejected from the game if given a red card. Note that, if given
                    two yellow cards in the same game, it'll convert your cards into a red, ejecting you from the game as well. 
                    This leaves your team down one player that cannot be brought back, meaning your total number of players goes 
                    from 11 to 10.

                <p style="margin-right: 20em;line-height: 1.5;">
                    The main focus of the game is to end with more goals than your opponent. The best way to achieve 
                    this is by working as a team and working together to work around your opponents. Although it may feel 
                    tempting to perform selfish acts, try to remember that you have your whole team to help you win the game.

                <p style="margin-right: 20em;line-height: 1.5;"> 
                    The game is all about timing, and making sure you know when is the right time to push forward. 
                    Try to stay aware of your sorroundings and keep a mental image of everyone on the pitch and their 
                    position. Making key passes to create an opening are crucial for developing chances that can lead 
                    to goals.
